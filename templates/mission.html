    <p>Making technology safe, approachable, and easy to use for everyone.</p>

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>A world where technology empowers every person, regardless of their background or experience level. Where complexity is not a barrier but an opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

            <h3>The Problem We're Solving</h3>
            <p>Technology has become essential to modern life, yet many people feel left behind. The gap between tech experts and everyday users keeps growing. Complex systems, poor documentation, security concerns, and exclusionary design leave millions struggling.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We're here to change that. Every person deserves access to technology that works for them, not against them.</p>

            <h3>Our Approach</h3>
            <p>We believe in three core principles:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>Simplicity First:</strong> Complex doesn't mean confusing. We make technology accessible without dumbing it down.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency Always:</strong> Open source code, open communication, open decision-making. You can see exactly how we work.</li>
                <li><strong>Security by Default:</strong> We never compromise on safety. Privacy and security are built in from day one, not added later.</li>
