    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Exabyte was founded on a simple belief: technology should serve people, not the other way around. We noticed that many people felt intimidated or excluded by the complexity of the tech world. That changed everything.</p>

            <h3>The Problem We Saw</h3>
            <p>Every day, people struggle with technology that's:
            </p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>Too complex and unintuitive</li>
                <li>Lacking proper security and privacy protection</li>
                <li>Not designed with accessibility in mind</li>
                <li>Difficult to learn and understand</li>
                <li>Unwelcoming to newcomers</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">We realized that most tech solutions are built by experts, for experts. The everyday person is left behind.</p>
